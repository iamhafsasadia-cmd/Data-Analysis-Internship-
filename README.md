 Data-Analysis-Internship-
    This repository contains the work completed and currently in progress as part of my Data Analysis Internship at INTERNCALL. The internship focuses on developing practical skills in data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets. So far, I have been learning and applying core Python programming concepts such as functions, looping statements, control statements, and proper code indentation to write structured and efficient code. I am also gaining hands-on experience with essential Python libraries including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for creating visual representations of data. This repository will be continuously updated to reflect my learning progress, tasks, and projects completed throughout the duration of the internship.
